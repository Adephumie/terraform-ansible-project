![infrastructures-architectural-diagram](images/project-image.png "infrastructures-architectural-diagram")

This is another mini-project from AltSchool that seeks to explore my understanding of deploying infrastructures with Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code Tool.

The instructions to the project has been shared in the [`instructions.txt`](instructions.txt) file located in the project's directory.

Happy Coding!!!
